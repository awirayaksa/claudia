# Claudia - Claude's Cooler Cousin 😎

> "Why pay for Claude Desktop when you can build your own janky version at 3 AM?" - Ancient Developer Proverb

A Windows desktop application that's basically Claude Desktop but with more bugs and personality. Built with Electron because we hate RAM and love living dangerously.

## 🎭 What Is This Thing?

It's like Claude Desktop, but imagine if it was built by someone who really, really wanted to understand how everything works under the hood. Spoiler alert: Now I know, and I have regrets. Just kidding! (Mostly.)

This Electron app connects to Open WebUI and lets you chat with AI models while pretending you're using the official Claude Desktop app. Your friends will be so impressed. Or confused. Probably confused.

## ✨ Features (That Actually Work!)

- 💬 **Chat interface** - It's a chatbox. You type, AI responds. Revolutionary stuff here.
- 🎥 **Real-time streaming** - Watch the words appear like magic! (It's not magic, it's Server-Sent Events)
- 📎 **File uploads** - Drag, drop, pray it doesn't crash
- 💾 **Conversation history** - So you can remember that embarrassing prompt from last Tuesday
- 📁 **Project system** - Organize your conversations like the productive person you pretend to be
- 🎨 **Dark mode** - Because your eyes deserve better at 2 AM
- 🔧 **MCP Server Support** - Give your AI superpowers with 26 custom tools! (May or may not crash)
- 🤖 **Auto-tool calling** - The AI will use tools automatically. It's like giving a toddler a toolbox, but smarter.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (AKA "Things That Will Break")

- **Electron 28** - Because why use 100MB when you can use 300MB?
- **React 18** - Hooks everywhere! useState this, useEffect that!
- **TypeScript** - JavaScript with training wheels (that we ignore with `any`)
- **Redux Toolkit** - Global state go brrrrr
- **Tailwind CSS** - `className="flex items-center justify-between bg-surface p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md hover:bg-surface-hover transition-colors duration-200"` - yeah, super readable
- **Vite** - Fast builds so you can break things faster
- **Electron Builder** - Turns your 300MB app into a 150MB installer. Math!

## 🚀 Getting Started (Good Luck!)

### Prerequisites (Things You Need Before the Pain Begins)

- Node.js 18+ (the higher the better, like your caffeine intake)
- npm or yarn (pick your poison)
- An Open WebUI instance (because we're too lazy to build our own backend)
- Patience (not included in package.json)
- Coffee ☕ (lots of it)

### Installation (The Fun Part)

1. **Clone this bad boy:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd claudia
# Take a moment to appreciate what you're about to do
```

2. **Install dependencies** (go make coffee, this takes a while):
```bash
npm install
# Meanwhile: 3000 packages, 200MB node_modules, 1 questionable life choice
```

3. **Start the dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
# If it doesn't work on the first try, you're doing it right!
```

4. **Watch it compile:**
```
✓ 1 modules transformed
✓ 5 modules transformed
✓ 42 modules transformed
[vite] hmr update /src/App.tsx
# This is fine 🔥
```

## 📦 Build Commands (For When You Want to Share the Pain)

```bash
# Development (AKA "Fix Bugs Simulator")
npm run dev              # Hot reload your mistakes in real-time!

# Production Build (AKA "Package Your Bugs Professionally")
npm run build            # Pray to the TypeScript gods
npm run build:win        # Creates a 150MB installer. You're welcome, users!

# Code Quality (LOL)
npm run lint             # Finds 127 problems (125 warnings, 2 errors)
npm run format           # Makes your code pretty (but not functional)
npm run type-check       # TypeScript: "I found 47 issues" You: "any goes brrr"
```

## ⚙️ Configuration (The "Make It Work" Part)

First time? Here's how to not break things:

1. Click the Settings button (top-right, you can't miss it)
2. Enter your Open WebUI URL (usually `http://localhost:8080` if you're cool)
3. Paste your API key (from Settings > Account in Open WebUI)
   - **Pro tip:** Don't commit this to git. We've all been there.
4. Pick a model (any model, they're all smarter than us anyway)
5. Click "Save" and hope for the best

### MCP Servers (For the Brave)

Want to give your AI actual powers? Configure MCP servers!

1. Go to Settings > MCP Servers
2. Click "Import from Claude Desktop" if you're lazy (recommended)
3. Or manually add servers if you enjoy pain
4. Watch your AI use 26 different tools to accomplish what you could've googled

**Known Issues:**
- API key resets on startup ~~(we're working on it)~~ FIXED! 🎉
- First message doesn't show up ~~(just send it again)~~ FIXED! 🎉
- "View Logs" button might make you cry (errors are scary)
- Tools show in settings but not in chat ~~(turn it off and on again)~~ FIXED! 🎉
- Input stays disabled after "New Chat" ~~(refresh the page)~~ FIXED! 🎉

## 🐛 Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong)

### "It won't start!"
